She'll rip your shirt within a second
You'll be comin' back, back for seconds
With your plate, you just can't help it

You'll play alo-o-ong, let her lead you o-o-on
You'll be sayin', ""No, no""

“Kings & Queens” is a song by Ava Max, released on March 12, 2020 as a single from her album Heaven & Hell.
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own
Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (Oh)
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be bigger than yours
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own
Disobey me, then baby, it's off with your head
Gonna change it and make it a world you won't forget (Oh)
No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But I'm stronger than I ever was before
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own
In chess, a king can move one space at a time
But queens are free to go wherever they like
You get too close, you'll get a royalty high
So breathe it in to feel alive
If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
We would pop champagne and raise a toast
To all of the queens who are fighting alone
Baby, you're not dancing on your own
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh"

Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause, baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)
Can you hear the whispers all across the room?
You feel their eyes all over you like cheap perfume
You're beautiful, but misunderstood
So why you tryna be just like the neighborhood?
I can see ya, I know what you're feelin'
So let me tell you 'bout my little secret
I'm a little crazy underneath this
Underneath this
Do you ever feel like a misfit?
Everything inside you is dark and twisted
Oh, but it's okay to be different

You don't have to fit into the format
Oh, but it's okay to be different
'Cause, baby, so am I (So am I, so am I, so am I-I-I-I-I)
Oh, so dress up fancy like Sid and Nancy (Yeah)
Walkin' Killer Queen, gotta keep 'em guessin'
So, baby, come pass me a lighter
We're gonna leave 'em on fire (Ah)
We're the sinners and the blessings (Oh yeah)

You show me love and give me war
I can't get enough, can't take anymore
Oh no, right now, baby, I'm torn
I, I always want to run, run, run away
But, but then I crawl into your arms
It, it's like we're starting drama every day

Like a spider, there's a web that you have wove
There's a heart now, where there used to be a ghost
And ooh, yeah it's making me uneasy
Now I hear sounds in the hallway
Rocking chairs are moving on their own
I'm falling for you
So much so that it's freaking me out
So much so that it's freaking me out

If you wanna go six inch or flat
Wanna wear hot pink or black

Told you on the first night
This isn't my first time
You won't be the last one
Blame it on my past life
Only want the fast life
Always on the run
Got this feeling in my brain
In my blood and in my veins
Tellin' me to never slow down
Reachin' for another touch
Know you wanna hold me but
Now you're only holding me down
Oh, woah
Tonight I'm having fun, I'm sleeping with the sun
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a wild thing, baby
If looks could kill a man, your life is in my hands
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a wild thing, baby
I'm running away, can't stop me
I'm not gonna say I'm sorry
I made a few mistakes, but one is all it takes
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a wild thing, baby
Barely left a scent, no
Echoes in your bedroom
Only paint and perfume
Might have left a scratch
My nails across your back
I never meant to hurt you
Ooh, ooh
Got this feeling in my brain
In my blood and in my veins
Tellin' me to never slow down
Reachin' for another touch
Know you wanna hold me but
Now you're only holding me down

Oh, man, another one bites the dust
Another shot to my trust, another point down for love
But goddamn, twenty-inch heels, I'm up
Thinkin' how low I got
The mountain I had to jump, ain't fallin' again
So show up bright out of the blue, that's your decision
If that's what you just gotta do, see what you're missin'
I'm up here like, ""What would Jesus do?"" Forget him, forgive him
Watch me dance, lost your chance, now I won't hold your hand
